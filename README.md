1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

The best way to understand the user needs is to sit down and have a face-to-face meeting with the client and a focus group of users. This allows everyone to ask questions, communicate ideas, and inspire each other. Ultimately the client has the final say in what they want to be developed but if they want what's best for the success of their company, then they will want to address their users thoughts and opinions. Likewise, for the success of the agile team, they need to listen to what the client wishes and do their best to bring the clients vison to life. After meeting with the client and customers, the product owner has the task of building backlog or "user stories". The best way to interpret the users needs at this point is to break the project up into small stories and start the scrum team off with a focus on the base level stories to build a foundation for the project. Then as the project developes, further communication with the client and users can refine the final details for the next bactch of stories being taken into future sprints.  Creating "user stories" makes it so the project can be broken down into smaller increments rather then trying to visualize the perfect final product from day one. 

2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

It is important to minimalize the work down while still providing a technically excellent product. Following the agile concepts will help with my future work as I can get overly focused into small details and over work them. Working in a sprint format is a technique that I feel would work well for me. Breaking up a project into small increments and giving myself time limits for each increment so that I produce a working product withoug rewritting code over and over again to make it "prettier". Sometimes keeping things simple can be have the best results and the least room for errors to occure. 


3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Agile methodology requires a level of maturity and trust amongest team members. Allowing a team to be self organized and for each member to be able to choose what tasks that they can accomplish each day means that to be a good team member you need to be honest and have a good work ethic. Being a good team member means setting realistic daily goals while still pulling one's own weight. Don't promise more then you can accomplish but don't under estimate your capabilities and waste the teams time. It also means stepping up and if something goes wrong for a fellow team member and they don't accomplish their goal, help them and support them. It doens't matter if it software development or any other field, your team is your work family and you should be there to support one another.
